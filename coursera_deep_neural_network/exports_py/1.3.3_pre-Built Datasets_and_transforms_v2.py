# <h2>Preparation</h2>

# The following are the libraries we are going to use for this lab. The <code>torch.manual_seed()</code> is for forcing the random function to give the same number every time we try to recompile it.
# 

# In[1]:


# These are the libraries will be used for this lab.

# !pip install torchvision==0.9.1 torch==1.8.1 
import torch 
import matplotlib.pylab as plt
import numpy as np
torch.manual_seed(0)


# This is the function for displaying images.
# 

# In[2]:


# Show data by diagram

def show_data(data_sample, shape = (28, 28)):
    plt.imshow(data_sample[0].numpy().reshape(shape), cmap='gray')
    plt.title('y = ' + str(data_sample[1]))

# 

# You will focus on the following libraries: 
# 

# In[3]:


# Run the command below when you do not have torchvision installed
# !conda install -y torchvision

import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import torchvision.datasets as dsets


# We can import a prebuilt dataset. In this case, use MNIST. You'll work with several of these parameters later by placing a transform object in the argument <code>transform</code>.
# 

# In[7]:


# Import the prebuilt dataset into variable dataset


dataset = dsets.MNIST(
    root = './data',  
    download = True, 
    transform = transforms.ToTensor()
)


# Each element of the dataset object contains a tuple. Let us see whether the first element in the dataset is a tuple and what is in it.
# 

# In[8]:


# Examine whether the elements in dataset MNIST are tuples, and what is in the tuple?

print("Type of the first element: ", type(dataset[0]))
print("The length of the tuple: ", len(dataset[0]))
print("The shape of the first element in the tuple: ", dataset[0][0].shape)
print("The type of the first element in the tuple", type(dataset[0][0]))
print("The second element in the tuple: ", dataset[0][1])
print("The type of the second element in the tuple: ", type(dataset[0][1]))
print("As the result, the structure of the first element in the dataset is (tensor([1, 28, 28]), tensor(7)).")


# As shown in the output, the first element in the tuple is a cuboid tensor. As you can see, there is a dimension with only size 1, so basically, it is a rectangular tensor.<br>
# The second element in the tuple is a number tensor, which indicate the real number the image shows. As the second element in the tuple is <code>tensor(7)</code>, the image should show a hand-written 7.
# 

# <!--Empty Space for separating topics-->
# 

# Let us plot the first element in the dataset:
# 

# In[9]:


# Plot the first element in the dataset

show_data(dataset[0])


# As we can see, it is a 7.
# 

# Plot the second sample:   
# 

# In[10]:


# Plot the second element in the dataset

show_data(dataset[1])

# 

# <h2 id="Torchvision"> Torchvision Transforms  </h2> 
# 

# We can apply some image transform functions on the MNIST dataset.
# 

# As an example, the images in the MNIST dataset can be cropped and converted to a tensor. We can use <code>transform.Compose</code> we learned from the previous lab to combine the two transform functions.
# 

# In[ ]:


# Combine two transforms: crop and convert to tensor. Apply the compose to MNIST dataset

croptensor_data_transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.CenterCrop(20), transforms.ToTensor()])
dataset = dsets.MNIST(root = './data', download = True, transform = croptensor_data_transform)
print("The shape of the first element in the first tuple: ", dataset[0][0].shape)


# We can see the image is now 20 x 20 instead of 28 x 28.
# 

# <!--Empty Space for separating topics-->
# 

# Let us plot the first image again. Notice that the black space around the <b>7</b> become less apparent.
# 

# In[ ]:


# Plot the first element in the dataset

show_data(dataset[0],shape = (20, 20))


# In[ ]:


# Plot the second element in the dataset

show_data(dataset[1],shape = (20, 20))


# In the below example, we horizontally flip the image, and then convert it to a tensor. Use <code>transforms.Compose()</code> to combine these two transform functions. Plot the flipped image.
# 

# In[ ]:


# Construct the compose. Apply it on MNIST dataset. Plot the image out.

fliptensor_data_transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p = 1),transforms.ToTensor()])
dataset = dsets.MNIST(root = './data', download = True, transform = fliptensor_data_transform)
show_data(dataset[1])


# <!--Empty Space for separating topics-->
# 

# <h3>Practice</h3>
# 

# Try to use the <code>RandomVerticalFlip</code> (vertically flip the image) with horizontally flip and convert to tensor as a compose. Apply the compose on image. Use <code>show_data()</code> to plot the second image (the image as <b>2</b>).
# 

# In[ ]:


# Practice: Combine vertical flip, horizontal flip and convert to tensor as a compose. Apply the compose on image. Then plot the image
